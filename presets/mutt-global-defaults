# Additional global defaults for mutt.
#
# These are global bindings, so you'll want to use a dummy account to bind
# them to. For example:
#
#     [groups]
#     mutt_global_defaults = GLOBAL
#
# mutt_global_defaults: sets and sources alias file (and maybe more to come
# later)
#
# Optional:
# - alias_file: default is ~/.mutt/alias

[accounts %{mutt_global_defaults:-}]
alias_file        ?= ~/.mutt/alias
MUTT.alias_file   ?= "\"%alias_file\""
MUTT.'source '    += "\"%alias_file\""
